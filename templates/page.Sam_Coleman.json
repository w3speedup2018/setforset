He credits this to his father, who never cut him slack on chores (and there were plenty of them growing up!), his late grandfather and grandmother, who created a very successful business together that is still going strong to this day (over 70 years later), his mother for her innate business mindset, and his workouts, as they have helped him build both a resilient mind and body. Sam finds it extremely rewarding that SET FOR SET reaches tens of millions of people each year to help them with their fitness aspirations. He encourages you to reach out to him with questions, ideas, or just to say hi!","facebook_url":"","twitter_url":"","linkdin_url":"","instagram_url":""}}},"order":["main"]}
