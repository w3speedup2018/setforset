However, he really began serious resistance training while a student at Balliol College, Oxford, in 1964. He continued with a regimen of conventional free weight training and running for a half-century. In 2015, he became a devotee of \"unconventional fitness,\" and in recent years his favorite exercise devices have been macebells, Indian clubs, kettlebells, slamballs and medicine balls, keeping up his enthusiasm with varied daily workouts. Jan is a graduate of UCLA and Oxford and has a Ph.D. from UCLA. The bulk of his working career (31 years) was spent as an editor for firearms publications.","facebook_url":"shopify:\/\/blogs\/news","twitter_url":"","linkdin_url":"","instagram_url":""}}},"order":["main"]}
